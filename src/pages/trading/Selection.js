                The goal of trading or investing is to compound your capital without taking unnecessary risks. Although
                there are many financial markets like stocks, futures, bonds, market indices, precious metals, and
                currencies. we will be learning about achieving super-performance by trading stocks without substantial
                risk to your financial and mental capital.

            <div className="information information__highlight">
                Buy stocks which are already in a uptrend
            </div>
            <div className="selection__content">
                Most retail investors follow the "buy low, sell higher" rule and buy a stock when its price falls. Let
                us carefully examine the first part - "Buy low" doesn't necessarily mean to buy a stock when its price
                is at a discount. Although this strategy may work in some situations, many investors incur huge losses
                by buying stocks in a downtrend. For example, a stock drops from $100 to $50, and you bought some shares
                thinking the price may not go any lower. The stock price may recover and start trending up, but what if
                it drops to $40? Do you buy more shares and average down? What if the stock price further plummets to
                $20? No matter how good a company is, its stock price can still go lower. Stock market history provides
                many instances where stocks of once great companies went to Zero, and averaging down will wipe out your
                capital.
            </div>
            <div className="selection__content">
                Imagine you are running a fashion boutique with ten green and ten red dresses in the store. For whatever
                reason, consumers are eagerly buying red dresses compared to green ones. Now, if you want to re-stock
                your store, which dresses would you order more - green or red? The red ones, because they are in huge
                demand and selling out quickly. And what happens to the existing green dresses in the store? - you would
                offer a discount to sell out the low-demand merchandise to make space for the ones in high demand(red).
                Similar to the fashion boutique situation, as a stock trader, the goal is to buy stocks having high
                demand and sell them for a higher price to book profits. But, the price of a product with high demand
                will never go from $100 to $50. Instead, it will be trending upwards to greater than $100. That's why
                you don't buy stocks in a price downtrend. A downtrend implies lower demand. Change your mindset to
                follow the "buy high, sell higher" rule. Buy high means looking for stocks that are in an uptrend.
            </div>
            <div className="selection__content"> So what does stock in a downtrend or an uptrend means?
                All stocks have four stages in their lifecycle.
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <strong><em>Stage 1</em></strong>: Basing or accumulation period where institutional investors
                        slowly begin acquiring positions in a stock. The stock price will be range bound for months, or
                        in some cases, years. Moving averages will be almost flat. The stock may be at a bargain, but it
                        is not wise for an individual investor to initiate position as the price may not increase for a
                        long time, tying up your money which can invested in other names.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong><em>Stage 2</em></strong>: The advancing or uptrend phase is when the stock price breaks
                        out of the
                        accumulation phase price range accompanied by huge volume. The moving averages will be turning
                        up, and this is the ideal time to buy a stock. Most of the trading profits are made in this
                        stage 2 uptrend.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong><em>Stage 3</em></strong>: The topping or distribution phase is when institutional
                        investors start
                        unwinding their positions. The stage 2 uptrend loses momentum, price action begins to
                        move sideways, and volume picks up as the bulls and bears fight for control.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <strong><em>Stage 4</em></strong>: Declining or downtrend occurs as the remaining investors rush
                        to
                        liquidate their
                        positions. Volatility often increases even more during this phase.

                        <strong>

                                which are in stage 2 uptrend, your results improve drastically.

            </div>
            <div className="selection__content">
                So what causes an increased demand for a stock. In our fashion boutique situation, maybe the consumers
                prefer the red dresses because of the color red or the fitting or the fabric is softer. So what
                attributes of the stock drive the demand? Significant increase in recent one or two quarterly Earnings
                Per Share(EPS) compared to the prior year's same quarter(s) is the single most important element in
                stock selection. The greater the percentage increase, the better. Look for accelerating quarterly
                earnings growth, it’s not only the eps growth, but the rate of eps growth(earning’s surprises) that
                causes big stock price moves.Investors Business Daily concluded that 75 percent of the best-performing
                stocks from 1952 to 2001 showed earnings increases averaging more than 70% in the recent quarter before
                they began price advances. The best companies show earnings up 100% to 500% or more! A mediocre 10% or
                12% increase is not enough. When picking winning stocks, it's the bottom line that counts.

                Accelerated Revenue growth
            </div>
            <div className="selection__content"> Even though the EPS growth of companies is the best metric, not all
                growth rates are the same. Companies
                can still inflate earnings for a few quarters by reducing costs or spending less on advertising,
                research and development, and other constructive activities. Earnings growth accompanied by higher sales
                validates the quality of earnings. Annual revenue growth with accelerated earnings growth is the best
                criteria for finding super-performance stocks. Make sure to select stocks with 25% to 50% and higher
                annual revenue growth rates.

                High Relative Strength
            </div>
            <div className="selection__content">
                Relative Strength measures the stock performance relative to the stock market as a whole. The average RS
                Rating of the best performing stocks from the early 1950s through 2008, before their major run-ups was
                87(means the stocks are in top 87 percentile). In other words, the best stocks were already
                doing better than nearly 9 out of 10 others when they were starting out on their most explosive advance
                yet. So the rule for those who are determined to be big winners in the stock market is: look for the
                genuine leaders and avoid laggards and sympathy plays. Don’t buy stocks with Relative Strength Ratings
                in the 40s, 50s, or 60s.
