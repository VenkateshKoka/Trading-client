                Buying demand for a stock causes its price to rise, and selling causes its price to fall. The higher
                this demand, the better chance to continue its upward move. But how to know if there is high demand or
                not? - trading volume determines that. A big move up in price accompanied by higher than average
                volume(sometimes multiple times) suggest institutional investors are interested. Similarly, when a stock
                pullbacks on lower volume than average indicates the selling pressure is low. These two properties -
                higher volume during price advance and lower volume during decline, is what we are looking for.
                The goal is to ride this price momentum as these institutions take many days to buy the stock.

                You have to execute a trade when there is a high probability of the stock price moving up, and in
                addition to moving up, doing it rapidly. Often referred to as a pivot point. Sometimes the stock may go
                lower rapidly, called a pivot failure, but you get to know the result quickly instead of tying up your
                capital for a long time without much progress.

                When a stock is in a stage 2 uptrend, there will be pullbacks and basing periods. When the stocks are in
                a stage 2 uptrend, there will be pullbacks and basing periods(caused by profit taking or market
                corrections). When stocks break out from these bases, this is the time to buy the breakouts. These
                basing periods usually last from 5 to 26 weeks (in some cases, it may take more months and even more
                than a year). Generally, a stock tops(stage 3/ distribution phase) after 3-5 bases in the stage 2
                uptrend. The later basing periods coincide with becoming obvious with more volatility, and institutional
                demand dries up. Bases 1 and 2 generally come off a market correction, which is the best time to buy.
                <br/>
                <b>Pullback</b> - Once a stock price moves up, inevitably, there would be some sellers to take profits
                causing the price to pull back. Pullbacks are part and parcel of the game, but the extent of the
                pullback is significant. Imagine a stock moved from 100 to 150. Now, if the stock pulls back to 110,
                most of the buying is negated by selling. In another scenario, the same stock only comes back to 140,
                meaning the stock is acting well and there are fewer sellers and when the stock completes the base and
                breaks out on higher volume, this is the time to buy.
                <br/>
                <b>Base / basing period</b> - bases are formed when the sellers in the stock dry up over a period of
                time. These basing periods most commonly last from 5 to 26 weeks (but some cases it may take more months
                and even more than a year). Generally a stock tops after 3-5 bases in the stage 2 uptrend. The later
                basing periods become obvious with more volatility and eventually institutional demand dries up.
                Bases 1 and 2 generally comes off market correction, which is the best time to buy.

            <p>There are different types of bases: cup with a handle, Saucer with a handle, double bottom, flat-base,
                square box, high tight flags.
            </p>

            <h3>Powerplays / High tight flags</h3>
            <p>Characteristics of a high tight flag:
                <br/>
                1. A rare pattern usually seen during a bull market year.
                <br/>
                2. Usually a little known company, not widely known and certainly not the largest company in its
                industry.
                <br/>
                3. Company has a new product that turns the not so well known stock into one that runs up rapidly, 100
                to 120% or more in only 4 to 8 weeks and holds most of the huge gain while it moves sideways 3 to 5
                weeks and corrects between just 10 to 25%
            </p>

            <p>A “high, tight flag” price pattern is rare, occurring in no more than a few stocks during a bull market.
                It begins with the stock moving generally 100% to 120% in a very short period of time (four to eight
                weeks). It then corrects sideways no more than 10% to 25%, usually in three, four, or five weeks. This
                is the strongest of patterns, but it’s also risky and difficult to interpret correctly.

                cup with handles:

                Cup patterns can last from 7 weeks to as long as 65 (sometimes even more than that) weeks, but most of
                them
                last for three to six months.
                The usual correction from the absolute peak (the top of the cup) to the low point (the bottom of the
                cup) of
                this price pattern varies from around the 12% to 15% range to upwards of 33%. A strong price pattern of
                any
                type should always have a clear and definite price uptrend prior to the beginning of its base pattern.
                You
                should look for at least a 30% increase in price in the prior uptrend, together with improving relative
                strength and a substantial increase in trading volume at some points in the prior uptrend.

                When handles do occur, they almost always form in the upper half of the overall base structure, as
                measured
                from the absolute peak of the entire base to the absolute low of the cup. The handle should also be
                above
                the stock’s 10-week moving average price line. Handles that form in the lower half of an overall base or
                completely below the stock’s 10-week line are weak and failure-prone. Additionally, handles that
                consistently wedge up (drift upward along their price lows or just go straight sideways along their lows
                rather than drifting down) have a much higher probability of failing when they break out to new highs.
                This
                upward-wedging behavior along low points in the handle doesn’t let the stock undergo the needed shakeout
                or
                sharp price pullback after having advanced from the low of the base into the upper half of the pattern.
                This
                high-risk trait tends to occur in third- or fourth-stage bases, in laggard stock bases, or in very
                active
                market leaders that become too widely followed and therefore too obvious. You should beware of wedging
                handles.

                When a stock forms a proper cup-with-handle chart pattern and then charges through an upside buy point,
                which Jesse Livermore referred to as the “pivot point” or “line of least resistance,” the day’s volume
                should increase at least 40% to 50% above normal. During major breakouts, it’s not uncommon for new
                market
                leaders to show volume spikes 200%, 500%, or 1,000% greater than the average daily volume.

                Pivot buy points in correct chart base patterns are not typically based on a stock’s old high price.
                Most of
                them occur at 5% to 10% below the prior peak. The peak price in the handle area is what determines most
                buy
                points, and this is almost always somewhat below the base’s actual high. This is crucial to
                remember.
                If you wait for an actual new high price, you will often buy too late. Sometimes you can get a slight
                head
                start by drawing a downtrend line from the overall pattern’s absolute peak downward across the peak
                where
                the stock begins building the handle. Then begin your purchase when the trend line is broken on the
                upside a
                few weeks later. However, you have to be right in your chart and stock analysis to get away with this.
